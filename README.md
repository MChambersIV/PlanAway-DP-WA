Daily Planner

##
This is a simple Daily Planner as the name suggests.

When you load the page you will see the title and the current time. You will also see forms to save todo's for the current workday from 8am all the way to 5pm.

The form allows you to fill in the form and save your notes pertaining to that time with the large save button just underneath it.

If you reload or close the page your previously saved notes will persist because this information has been saved in your local storage.

Very simple and yet very useful. This was a practice in both displaying time using an api and making use of local storage in javascript for which I'm happy to say was a success.
